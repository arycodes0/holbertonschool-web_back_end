# Pagination in Web Back-End

This README provides a brief overview of different pagination techniques in web back-end development.

## Simple Pagination with page and page_size Parameters

To paginate a dataset using simple parameters, you can utilize the `page` and `page_size` parameters. The `page` parameter represents the current page number, while the `page_size` parameter determines the number of items to display per page. By adjusting these parameters, you can navigate through the dataset efficiently.

## Pagination with Hypermedia Metadata

Another approach to pagination involves utilizing hypermedia metadata. Hypermedia metadata provides additional information about the dataset, such as the total number of pages, the current page, and links to navigate to the next or previous pages. This technique enhances the user experience by providing a more intuitive way to navigate through the dataset.

## Deletion-Resilient Pagination

Deletion-resilient pagination ensures that the pagination remains consistent even when items are deleted from the dataset. This technique typically involves using unique identifiers for each item and updating the pagination logic accordingly. By implementing deletion-resilient pagination, you can ensure a seamless user experience even when items are removed from the dataset.
