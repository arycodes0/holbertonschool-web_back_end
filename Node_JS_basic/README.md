## Run JavaScript using Node.js
Node.js allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser. This is useful for server-side scripting and building scalable network applications.

## Use Node.js Modules
Node.js has a module system that allows you to organize your code into reusable components. You can use built-in modules or create your own.

## Use Specific Node.js Module to Read Files
The `fs` module in Node.js provides an API to interact with the file system. You can use it to read, write, and manipulate files.

## Use Process to Access Command Line Arguments and the Environment
The `process` object in Node.js provides information about the current Node.js process. You can use it to access command line arguments and environment variables.

## Create a Small HTTP Server using Node.js
Node.js has a built-in `http` module that allows you to create a simple HTTP server. This server can handle HTTP requests and send responses.

## Create a Small HTTP Server using Express.js
Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js. It simplifies the process of creating a robust HTTP server with additional features like routing and middleware.

## Create Advanced Routes with Express.js
Express.js allows you to create advanced routes to handle different HTTP methods and URL patterns. This is useful for building RESTful APIs.

## Use ES6 with Node.js with Babel-node
Babel-node is a tool that allows you to use ES6 features in your Node.js applications. It transpiles your ES6 code to ES5, making it compatible with Node.js.

## Use Nodemon to Develop Faster
Nodemon is a utility that automatically restarts your Node.js application when file changes are detected. This speeds up the development process by eliminating the need to manually restart the server.
